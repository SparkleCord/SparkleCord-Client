## What You Can Help With
- Features (size doesn't matter, if it's a feature, it's fine)
- UI/UX improvements (e.g. color fixes, new UI elements, etc.)
- Performance tweaks/improvements
- Bugfixes to help stabilize the code
- Improving code style or file structure
---
## Guidelines (don't take this too seriously)
- Keep your code clean and understandable
- Try to follow the existing code style (though this isn't required)
- Commit messages should be short but clear (e.g. "Added a cat button to the input box that sends a random cat image.")
- Avoid unnecessary logs unless you're debugging (but delete them before publishing)
---
## Pushing
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "short but useful message"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
Then, open a purr request when you're ready :3
#### (a pull request, but I like cats a lot)
