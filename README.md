<summary><strong>⚖️ SparkleCord Acceptable Use Terms</strong></summary><br>

SparkleCord's code and logic are completely custom-made (*unless explicitly stated otherwise*). Any use of Discord’s branding or styles is purely for **demonstration**. This project is **not** meant to compete with or replace Discord. Whether you use it or not is entirely your choice — we will *never* force it on anyone.<br>
### By using SparkleCord, you agree to these terms:<br>
1. **Not Discord:** SparkleCord is fan-made. It’s not official, affiliated, or endorsed by Discord. And it **never** will be.<br>
2. **No Staff Impersonation:** Pretending to be Discord or server staff using SparkleCord is not allowed.<br>
3. **Don't Deceive Users:** Using SparkleCord as a way to spread misinformation is not allowed and you may be suspended.<br>
4. **API Usage:** SparkleCord doesn’t use Discord’s API (webhooks are an exception), don't use modded SparkleCord clients to violate Discord rules.<br>
5. **SparkleCord is FREE:** Making a paid version of SparkleCord is discouraged, keep all contributions FOSS.<br>
6. **Discord Consequences:** If you use SparkleCord as a crosschat for Discord (we don't mind), make sure to respect *their* rules too.<br>
7. **Use Common Sense:** This is not an exhaustive list, please be responsible with your use of SparkleCord.<br>
### Violating the terms may lead to the following consequences:<br>
- **Suspension from Official Communities** - We take neccesary measures to ensure bad actors are not in our community.
- **Flags** - We may flag you as untrusted depending on the severity of your actions.
- **Other necessary actions** to protect SparkleCord and its users.<br>
<br>
Use SparkleCord responsibly and just have fun :D<br>
