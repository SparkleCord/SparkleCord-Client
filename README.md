<summary><strong>⚖️ SparkleCord Acceptable Use Terms</strong></summary><br>

SparkleCord's code and logic are completely custom-made (*unless explicitly stated otherwise*). Any use of Discord’s branding or styles is purely for **demonstration**. This project is **not** meant to compete with or replace Discord. Whether you use it or not is entirely your choice — we will *never* force it on anyone.<br>
### By using SparkleCord, you agree to these terms:<br>
1. **Not Discord.** - SparkleCord is fan-made. It’s not official, affiliated, or endorsed by Discord. And it never will be.<br>
2. **No Staff Impersonation.** - Pretending to be Discord or server staff using SparkleCord is **not allowed**.<br>
3. **No Misleading Tricks.** - Fake messages, features, or screenshots meant to deceive = not cool.<br>
4. **API Use Is on You.** - SparkleCord doesn’t use Discord’s API. If you make a plugin/client mod that does, it’s unofficial and risky. Know what you’re doing. If you abuse it, **Discord will handle you**, not us.<br>
5. **No Selling SparkleCord.** - You can’t sell it, reskin it for profit, or monetize it in any way.<br>
6. **Still Under Discord’s ToS.** - Using SparkleCord to interact with Discord? You’re still bound by **Discord’s ToS**. Break them, face their consequences.<br>
7. **Use Common Sense.** - If you're asking “can I do this?” the answer’s probably “no.” Just don’t be sketchy.<br>
### ❗ Breaking rules may lead to the following consequences:<br>
- **Discord punishments** if you misuse their API through plugins, client mods, etc. That’s on you.<br>
- **Bans from SparkleCord support spaces** if you break serious rules (e.g. impersonation or harassment).<br>
- **Trust revoked** — your instance/name may be flagged as untrustworthy.<br>
- **Other necessary actions** to protect SparkleCord and its users.<br>
<br>
Use SparkleCord responsibly and just have fun :D<br>
